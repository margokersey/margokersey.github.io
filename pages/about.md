I studied applied mathematics and cognitive science at UCLA. Here, I worked with Dr. Hongjing Lu and Dr. Gennady Erlikhman at the Computational Vision and Learning Lab. I also interned at Forschungszentrum Julich Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine through the DAAD RISE program.

I currently work at the UCSF Dyslexia Center (University of California, San Francisco) where I work with multimodal neuroimaging data.
