For the past 3 years, I have been working at the [UCSF Dyslexia Center](https://dyslexia.ucsf.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. Pedro Pinheiro-Chagas](https://albalab.ucsf.edu/people/pedro-pinheiro-chagas-phd) leveraging neuroimaging and neuropsychological data to study the neural underpinnings of language and mathematics in the developing brain. As a member of the [ALBA Language Neurobiology Lab](https://albalab.ucsf.edu/) at the [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](https://memory.ucsf.edu/) led by [Dr. Marilu Gorno Tempini](https://albalab.ucsf.edu/people/marilu-gorno-tempini-md-phd), Iâ€™ve had the privilege of collaborating with a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neuropsychologists, cognitive neuroscientists, educational specialists, speech & language pathologists, and bioengineers. My passion lies in uncovering new perspectives in cognitive data through advanced computational methods and innovative visualization tools.

Prior to UCSF, I studied applied mathematics and cognitive science at UCLA, where I worked with Dr. Hongjing Lu in the [Computational Vision and Learning Lab](https://cvl.psych.ucla.edu/) investigating deep learning models of human visual perception.
